2.  **Sentiment Intelligence:** Utilizes `RoBERTa-base` trained on social media data to classify inputs as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
3.  **Neural Machine Translation (NMT):** Bridges language gaps via the Google NMT engine.
4.  **Frontend:** Built with Streamlit for a responsive, "glassmorphism" UI design.
